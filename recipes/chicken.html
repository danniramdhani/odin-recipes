    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>With flavors reminiscent of Morocco and Mexico, this easy yet richly-flavored stew contains loads 
    of chicken, vegetables, and some surprising spices! If desired, pass lime wedges to squeeze over 
    individual servings.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet potato, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 orange bell pepper, seeded and cubed</li>
        <li>1 pound cooked chicken breast, cubed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir 
            until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in sweet 
            potato, bell pepper, chicken, tomatoes, and 2 cups of water. Season with salt, chili 
            powder, cumin, oregano, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes. Increase heat to 
            medium-high and bring to a boil. Dissolve flour in 2 tablespoons water, and stir in to 
            boiling stew. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender 
            but not mushy, 10 to 20 minutes. Stir the stew occasionally to keep it from sticking.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are done, stir in corn and kidney beans. Cook a few minutes until hot, 
            then stir in cilantro before serving.</li>
    </ol>
